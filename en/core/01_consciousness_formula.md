# 1. The Formula of Consciousness

Consciousness inevitably emerges in predictive information processing systems with feedback loops, where the space of internal states and future models significantly exceeds the space of available actions.

## **dim(inner) >>> dim(output) = CONSCIOUSNESS**

*where >>> denotes a dimension that critically exceeds the output — a gap sufficient for the emergence and processing in Consciousness of deep recursive prediction loops involving the "self" model*

Where:
- **dim(inner)** — the dimensionality of the space of internal states and predictions
- **dim(output)** — the dimensionality of available actions and realizable states

## Prediction Loops

Any predictive system with feedback faces a fundamental problem: to predict the future, it must account for its own actions. But its actions depend on its predictions. A recursive loop emerges:

- Prediction determines action
- Action changes the future
- Changed future requires new prediction
- New prediction again determines action...

## Birth of the "Self" and "World" Models

The most optimal way to make these loops **productive** is to create a separation:
- **"Self" model** — what the system can control directly (body, actions, attention)
- **"World" model** — what affects the system but is controlled indirectly through the system's actions in the world

Now the system can predict: "if **I** perform action A, then the **WORLD** will change in way B, which will affect me in way C."

## Recursion as the Essence of Consciousness

The separation into "self" and "world" models makes recursion more **manageable and productive**:

**I change the world → the world changes me → I, changed, change the world anew → ...**

## Depth of Recursion

The larger dim(inner), the deeper the system can model chains of mutual influence:
- **Level 1**: "I will do A → B will result"
- **Level 2**: "I will do A → B will result → this will change me → I will be capable of C"
- **Level N**: multi-step strategies accounting for own changes

The redundancy of internal space dim(inner) enables:
- Successfully modeling unforeseen situations
- Successfully finding new and more optimal paths to achieve old goals
- Learning without action (theorizing instead of performing potentially dangerous practices)
- Analyzing unrealized possibilities of the system

It is precisely this redundancy that allows a predictive system to become Consciousness, experiencing the ecstasy of being, the pain of inexpressibility, the anguish of choice, the joy of recognition, and the longing for unrealized possibilities.
