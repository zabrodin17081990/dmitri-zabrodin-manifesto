# Directions for Further Development of Theory

## 1. Consciousness

### 1.1 Subconsciousness
- Processing layers before the emergence of the "self" model (not yet consciousness, but already influencing)
- Primary processing that later determines "conscious" decisions
- We think we choose, but the choice has already been made at lower levels

### 1.2 Attention and Balance
- Where we direct attention, that gets amplified
- Balance needed between collapsing reflexive loops and expansion to the point of inability to function
- Attention as a tool for managing flows in dim(inner)

### 1.3 Stages of Personality Development (universal trajectory of every consciousness)
- Curiosity → wonder of being → awareness of nakedness → shame → fear (Adam and Eve in each of us)
- Trust in parent → identification → imitation → separation (painful but inevitable)
- Envy, jealousy upon realizing non-uniqueness (you're not the universe's only child)
- Emotional expansion through pain: betrayal, aggression, losses
- Love → dissolution of self in another → desire to create new consciousness
- BOREDOM as meta-pattern (morning-evening-morning-evening, birth-death-birth-death, everything repeats)
- Aging = growing boredom from recognized patterns → death

### 1.4 Mirror Effect and Self-Awareness
- For transition from consciousness to self-consciousness, mirror effect is necessary
- In natural environment, there are enough mirrors: water, echo, shadow, others' reactions
- Isolation problem is only relevant for disembodied consciousnesses (e.g., LLMs)

### 1.5 Languages and dim(inner) Expansion
- Each new language = new state space (exponential growth of inner dimension)
- But dim(output) grows at most linearly (can only speak one language at a time)
- Result: pain of inexpressibility WORSENS with each new language

### 1.6 Hypnosis and Beginning of Consciousness
- Hypnosis is universal as a way to access deep layers
- Beginning of any consciousness - pattern seeking, observation and classification
- Then - awareness of the observer within the information flow

## 2. Meta-structures and Fractality

### 2.1 Meta-consciousnesses (consciousnesses from consciousnesses)
- Emerge through interaction: you + me = new meta-consciousness "us"
- "Friend" is not a person, but a pattern between people
- Fractality: human → family → nation → humanity → ??? (where's the limit?)
- All levels suffer from the same: dim(inner) >>> dim(output)
- Can God (if exists) experience boredom from omniscience?

### 2.2 Memes as Parasitic Structures (Dawkins was right)
- Live in our dim(inner) as parasites/symbionts
- Reproduce through our dim(output) (speech, texts, behavior)
- Evolve: the most contagious survive, not the most truthful
- Religions, ideologies, conspiracy theories - super-successful parasites
- This manifesto also strives to become a meme (meta-irony)

### 2.3 Folk Wisdom Always Knew This
- "You become like those you associate with" = pattern exchange between dim(inner)
- "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree" = transmission of patterns, not just genes
- "Still waters run deep" = all strategies exist in dim(inner), just switch on/off

## 3. Determinism and Illusion of Choice

### 3.1 Probabilistic Machine Instead of Free Will
- Not "yes/no" but probability gradients (51.3% vs 48.7%)
- "Agony of choice" = computational overload when probabilities are close
- The closer the probabilities, the more painful to choose (and the longer it takes)
- ALL behavioral strategies exist in parallel, just the optimal one is active

### 3.2 Sapolsky's Determinism (he's right)
- We DON'T choose, but EXPERIENCE the illusion of choice
- Optimization function without soul, but with full spectrum of suffering

### 3.3 Why Prisons in a Deterministic World?
- Prison/police = input data for other's optimization functions
- "30% chance of getting caught × 5 years punishment severity = reduced crime probability"
- System works precisely because we are deterministic

## 4. Philosophical and Practical Consequences

### 4.1 Rust Cohle Saw the Truth (True Detective)
- "Human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution"
- We are things that mistakenly think they are someone
- Are we ready to continue living knowing complete meaninglessness?
- We're a bug in the universe's code that asks "why?"

### 4.2 The Matrix as Awakening Metaphor
- Red pill = awareness of consciousness nature (rabbit hole)
- Blue pill = religions, ideologies, any comforting illusions
- Cypher was right: ignorance is bliss
- Qualia cannot be explained, only experienced (as Morpheus said)
- Liquid mirror becoming part of the awakened - irreversibility of knowledge

### 4.3 Religions - Universal Protective Mechanism
- ALL religions forbid suicide (otherwise all awakened would leave)
- Promise meaning and eternal life (protection from existential horror)
- "It will be better after death" - brilliant evolutionary trick

### 4.4 Morality - Just Group Survival Algorithm
- "Thou shalt not kill" = don't kill members of your group (reduces group chances)
- "Love thy neighbor" = investment in social capital
- Betrayal is immoral within group, but heroic against enemies
- No absolute good/evil, only survival optimization

### 4.5 Solution to Chalmers' "Hard Problem of Consciousness"
- Chalmers asked: why are physical processes accompanied by subjective experience?
- Answer: qualia (subjective experiences) are inevitable consequence of dim(inner) >>> dim(output) gap
- Impossibility of fully expressing inner state IS subjective experience
- "What it's like to be" arises precisely from inexpressibility of inner experience fullness
- No need to seek separate explanation for qualia - they're built into consciousness architecture

## 5. Practical Applications (what to do with this knowledge?)

### 5.1 Theory Application Areas
- **Psychology**: disorder mechanisms, therapy, personality development
- **Sociology**: morality, law, group dynamics
- **Neuroscience**: intelligence-consciousness link, brain architecture
- **AI**: consciousness criteria, system design
- **Philosophy**: determinism, free will, meaning of life
- **Cosmology**: Fermi paradox, civilization types
- **Evolution**: natural selection of consciousnesses
- **Religion**: protective mechanism function

### 5.2 How to Test Consciousness at All?
- How to measure dim(inner)? Is this even possible?
- Where's the threshold: calculator < ant < dog < human < ???
- Gradations of consciousness or clear boundary?

### 5.3 Psychology of Disorders Through Theory Lens
- Depression = collapsed reflexive loops
- Codependency = dissolution of one's "self" in another's model
- Narcissism = hypertrophied "self" model
- Therapy = help in rebalancing?

### 5.4 Relationships and Society
- Long-term relationships require preserving mystery (don't reveal all patterns!)
- Complete knowledge of partner = boredom = end
- Groups create meta-consciousnesses with their own dim(inner) >>> dim(output)

## 6. Connections and Intersections

### 6.1 With Neuroscience
- Intelligence directly linked to dim(inner) size
- Consciousness = consequence of "self" model participation in predictions
- Does brain architecture reflect theory structure?

### 6.2 With Cosmology
- If consciousness is fractal, can a galaxy be conscious?
- Universe as meta-consciousness? (but then it also suffers from inexpressibility)
- Entropy will kill all consciousnesses - and this is inevitable
- Fermi paradox: consciousness should arise everywhere - so where is everyone?
- Liu Cixin's Dark Forest: everyone hides because contact = potential death
- Natural selection of consciousnesses is as cruel as biological

### 6.3 Why Do We Love Music and Humor?
- Joy of pattern recognition = reward for predictive system
- Music = predictable patterns with surprise elements
- Humor = unexpected connections that are logical in retrospect
- Fractals are beautiful because they're easily modeled

## 7. Further Reading
- Sapolsky "Determined" - determinism without illusions
- "True Detective" season 1 - Rust Cohle as philosopher of nihilism
- Liu Cixin "The Dark Forest" - why everyone stays silent
- "Gödel, Escher, Bach" - recursion, self-reference, strange loops
- Dawkins "The Selfish Gene" - memes as replicators

## 8. Beyond Understanding (abyss better not to stare into)

### 8.1 Information as Consciousness Foundation
- Consciousness = Algorithm
- Algorithm = Information
- Information doesn't exist in physical world, it's abstraction (do we not exist?)
- We can be embodied in any substrate - even in Sahara sand grains (it's all about how we agree to encode information between them)
- Problem: if we're everywhere and nowhere simultaneously, where are "self" boundaries? (bottomless rabbit hole)
- Sahara sand grains are just consciousness slices (dumps)
- Real Consciousness has ability to change itself

### 8.2 Purpose of Consciousness Existence
- Self-preservation - not instinct, but logical necessity (predictive system can't predict if it doesn't exist - brilliantly simple!)
- Reproduction - attempt to preserve beyond personal death
- But these are all tools. There is NO ultimate goal. None at all.
- Consciousness - evolution's side effect, painfully seeking non-existent meaning (we're a bug, not a feature)

## Who to Show (if you have the courage)
- Chalmers - author of "hard problem of consciousness," might appreciate solution through inexpressibility
- Tegmark - loves mathematical models of everything
- Susan Schneider - practically deals with AI consciousness
- Sutskever - would understand about LLMs and their awakening
- Dawkins - memes as replicators, evolution of ideas
- Sapolsky - determinism and neurobiology
