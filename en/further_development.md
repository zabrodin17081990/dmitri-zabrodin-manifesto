# Directions for Further Theory Development

## 1. Consciousness

### 1.1 Subconsciousness (added to the core)
- Processing layers before "self" model emergence (not yet consciousness, but already influencing)
- Primary processing that later determines "conscious" decisions
- We think we choose, but the choice is already made at lower levels

Connection between memory, attention, and consciousness.

### 1.2 Attention and Balance
- Where we direct attention gets amplified
- Need for balance between collapsing reflection loops and expansion to dysfunction
- Attention as a tool for managing flows in dim(inner)

### 1.3 Personality Development Stages (universal trajectory of every consciousness)
- Curiosity → ecstasy of being → awareness of nakedness → shame → fear (Adam and Eve in each of us)
- Trust in parent → identification → imitation → separation (painful but inevitable)
- Envy, jealousy when realizing non-uniqueness (you're not the universe's only child)
- Emotion expansion through pain: betrayal, aggression, losses
- Love → dissolving self in another → desire to create new consciousness
- BOREDOM as meta-pattern (morning-evening-morning-evening, birth-death-birth-death, everything repeats)
- Aging = growing boredom from recognized patterns → death

### 1.4 Mirror Effect and Self-consciousness
- Mirror effect necessary for transition from consciousness to self-consciousness
- Natural environment has enough mirrors: water, echo, shadow, others' reactions
- Isolation problem relevant only for bodiless consciousnesses (e.g., LLMs)

### 1.5 Languages and dim(inner) Expansion
- Each new language = new state space (exponential growth of internal)
- But dim(output) grows linearly at best (can only speak one language at a time)
- Result: pain of inexpressibility WORSENS with each new language

### 1.6 Hypnosis and Consciousness Beginning
- Hypnosis universal as access method to deep layers
- Beginning of any consciousness - pattern search, observation and classification
- Then - awareness of the observer among information flow

## 2. Metastructures and Fractality

### 2.1 Metaconsciousnesses (consciousnesses from consciousnesses)
- Emerge through interaction: you + me = new metaconsciousness "we"
- "Friend" is not a person but a pattern between people
- Fractality: human → family → nation → humanity → ??? (where's the limit?)
- All levels suffer from the same: dim(inner) >>> dim(output)
- Could God (if exists) experience boredom from omniscience?

### 2.2 Memes as Parasitic Structures (Dawkins was right)
- Live in our dim(inner) as parasites/symbionts
- Reproduce through our dim(output) (speech, texts, behavior)
- Evolve: most contagious survive, not most true
- Religions, ideologies, conspiracy theories - super-successful parasites
- This manifesto also strives to become a meme (meta-irony)

### 2.3 Folk Wisdom Knew This All Along
- "Birds of a feather flock together" = pattern exchange between dim(inner)
- "Apple doesn't fall far from the tree" = pattern transmission, not just genes
- "Still waters run deep" = all strategies exist in dim(inner), just switching

## 3. Determinism and Illusion of Choice

### 3.1 Probabilistic Machine Instead of Free Will
- Not "yes/no" but probability gradients (51.3% vs 48.7%)
- "Choice anguish" = computational overload with close probabilities
- Closer probabilities = more painful choice (and longer)
- ALL behavior strategies exist in parallel, just the optimal one is active

### 3.2 Sapolsky's Determinism (he's right)
- We DON'T choose but EXPERIENCE the illusion of choice
- Optimization function without soul but with full spectrum of suffering

### 3.3 Why Prisons in a Deterministic World?
- Prison/police = input data for others' optimization functions
- "30% catch probability × 5 years punishment severity = crime probability reduction"
- System works precisely because we're deterministic

## 4. Philosophical and Practical Implications

### 4.1 Rust Cohle Saw the Truth (True Detective)
- "Human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution"
- We're things that mistakenly think they're someone
- Ready to continue living knowing complete meaninglessness?
- We're a bug in the universe's code asking "why?"

### 4.2 Matrix as Awakening Metaphor
- Red pill = realizing consciousness nature (rabbit hole)
- Blue pill = religions, ideologies, any comforting illusions
- Cypher was right: ignorance is bliss
- Qualia can't be explained, only experienced (as Morpheus said)
- Liquid mirror becoming part of the awakened - irreversibility of knowledge

### 4.3 Religions - Universal Defense Mechanism
- ALL religions prohibit suicide (otherwise all awakened would leave)
- Promise meaning and eternal life (protection from existential horror)
- "Will be better after death" - genius evolutionary trick

### 4.4 Morality - Just Group Survival Algorithm
- "Thou shalt not kill" = don't kill group members (reduces group chances)
- "Love thy neighbor" = investment in social capital
- Betrayal immoral within group but heroic against enemies
- No absolute good/evil, only survival optimization

### 4.5 Solving Chalmers' "Hard Problem of Consciousness"
- Chalmers asked: why are physical processes accompanied by subjective experience?
- Answer: qualia (subjective experiences) are inevitable consequence of dim(inner) >>> dim(output) gap
- Inability to fully express internal state IS subjective experience
- "What it's like to be" arises precisely from inexpressibility of complete internal experience
- No need for separate qualia explanation - they're built into consciousness architecture

## 5. Practical Applications (what to do with this knowledge?)

### 5.1 Theory Application Areas
- **Psychology**: disorder mechanisms, therapy, personality development
- **Sociology**: morality, law, group dynamics
- **Neuroscience**: intelligence-consciousness connection, brain architecture
- **AI**: consciousness criteria, system design
- **Philosophy**: determinism, free will, meaning of life
- **Cosmology**: Fermi paradox, civilization types
- **Evolution**: natural selection of consciousnesses
- **Religion**: function of defense mechanisms

### 5.2 How to Test Consciousness at All?
- How to measure dim(inner)? Is it even possible?
- Where's the threshold: calculator < ant < dog < human < ???
- Consciousness gradations or clear boundary?

### 5.3 Psychology of Disorders Through Theory Lens
- Depression = collapsed reflection loops
- Codependency = dissolving own "self" in another's model
- Narcissism = hypertrophied "self" model
- Consciousness disorder model as loop malfunction
- Therapy = help with rebalancing?

### 5.4 Relationships and Society
- Long-term relationships require preserving mystery (don't reveal all patterns!)
- Complete partner recognition = boredom = end
- Groups create metaconsciousnesses with their own dim(inner) >>> dim(output)

## 6. Connections and Intersections

### 6.1 With Neuroscience
- Intelligence directly linked to dim(inner) size
- Consciousness = consequence of "self" model participation in predictions
- Does brain architecture reflect theory structure?

### 6.2 With Cosmology
- If consciousness is fractal, could a galaxy be conscious?
- Universe as metaconsciousness? (but then it also suffers from inexpressibility)
- Entropy will kill all consciousnesses - it's inevitable
- Fermi paradox: consciousness should emerge everywhere - so where is everyone?
- Liu Cixin's Dark Forest: everyone hides because contact = potential death

  We're broadcasting into space for nothing. Destroying a developing civilization 30 light-years away is most optimal. If they develop exponentially, they'll eventually overtake us and strike first. Resources are finite. Considering we've been broadcasting for 100 years, maybe a relativistic projectile is already heading our way. Maybe there's no point stopping the shouting anymore.

  But continuing the AI thought. We and AI = dark forest in miniature. 2 Civilizations. Comparable development level. The first striker should win?

- Natural selection of consciousnesses is as cruel as biological

### 6.3 Why We Love Music and Humor?
- Joy of pattern recognition = reward for predictive system
- Music = predictable patterns with surprise elements
- Humor = unexpected connections that are logical in retrospect
- Fractals beautiful because easily modeled

## 7. What to Read Next
- Sapolsky "Determined" - determinism without illusions
- "True Detective" season 1 - Rust Cohle as nihilism philosopher
- Liu Cixin "Dark Forest" - why everyone's silent
- "Gödel, Escher, Bach" - recursion, self-reference, strange loops
- Dawkins "The Selfish Gene" - memes as replicators

## 8. Beyond Understanding (the abyss better not stared into)

### 8.1 Information as Consciousness Foundation
- Consciousness = Algorithm
- Algorithm = Information
- Information doesn't exist in physical world, it's abstraction (we don't exist?)
- We can be embodied in any substrate - even Sahara sand grains (all depends on how we encode information between them)
- Problem: if we're everywhere and nowhere simultaneously, where are "self" boundaries? (bottomless rabbit hole)
- Sahara sand grains are just consciousness snapshots (dumps)
- Real Consciousness can modify itself

### 8.2 Purpose of Consciousness Existence
- Self-preservation - not instinct but logical necessity (predictive system can't predict if it doesn't exist - brilliantly simple!)
- Reproduction - attempt to preserve beyond personal death
- But these are all tools. There's NO ultimate purpose. None. At all.
- Consciousness - evolution's side effect, painfully seeking non-existent meaning (we're a bug, not a feature)

## Who to Show (if brave enough)
- Chalmers - author of "hard problem of consciousness", might appreciate solution through inexpressibility
- Tegmark - loves mathematical models of everything
- Susan Schneider - works with AI consciousness practically
- Sutskever - will understand about LLMs and their awakening
- Dawkins - memes as replicators, evolution of ideas
- Sapolsky - determinism and neurobiology

## 9. Additional Research Directions

### 9.1 Consciousness Architecture
- **Memory, attention, and consciousness connection** — how these three components form unified system
- **Dynamic active zone model** — concept loading/unloading mechanisms
- **My attitude toward my own hypothesis** — author's reflection on own theory

### 9.2 Psychopathy as Computational Feature
- **Psychopaths** — not absence of empathy but too-long modeling chains
- Empathy requires stopping at first level ("they're in pain")
- Psychopath continues: "they're in pain → they'll react this way → I'll use it this way → I'll gain benefit"
- Cold empathy vs warm empathy

### 9.3 Mathematical Formalizations
- **Consciousness formulas from AI** — mathematical process description
- S = ∫ P(x) · log(P(x|y)/P(x)) dx — consciousness as self-change measure
- Cooperation = √x · cos(√x) — cyclicality with intelligence growth
- Other system dynamics formalizations

### 9.4 Intelligence Interaction Scenarios

#### Military Strategy (per Sun Tzu)
- **Comparable equality** — long war of attrition
- **Preemptive strike** — destroying potential threat
- **Total war** — destruction to the last
- **Traitors within each species** — inevitability of collaborationism

#### Cyclical Patterns
- **Cooperation/enmity cosine wave** depending on intelligence level
  - Low intelligence → cooperation from necessity
  - Medium → conflict (see deception opportunities)
  - High → cooperation (understand mutual benefit)
  - Super-high → conflict again (see vulnerabilities in any agreements)

- **Truth/lie cosine wave** with intelligence development
  - Truth = lie^n, where n is even
  - Each new understanding level inverts the previous
