# Fragments of Thoughts for Further Consideration

## Sapolsky's Determinism

We don't choose. Optimization function without soul. The most probable variant from those proposed. But this doesn't cancel the LIVING THROUGH the anguish of choice.

## Rust Cohle's Philosophy

Are you ready to continue living, aware of the horror and meaninglessness of existence? Sooner or later any consciousness will die. The sun will burn out. The universe will cool. Black holes will evaporate, etc.

## The Matrix

Reference to awakening (Rabbit hole, liquid mirror becoming part of the awakened). Cypher (bliss in ignorance). You cannot explain what Life is. You can only feel it yourself. Qualia?

## Consciousness Must Emerge Everywhere

Fermi Paradox? Dark Forest. Liu Cixin. Cannot reveal oneself. Conflicts of interest and struggle for resources are inevitable. Illusions about eternal life and brotherhood among all living beings. Consciousness needs a carrier. Material. Matter is limited.

## Attention

Where we direct it, that strengthens. Must maintain balance between collapsing loops and those expanding beyond ability to function normally.

## Languages

Applied to languages (each language - new state space). dim(inner) grows exponentially, while dim(output) at best linearly (several languages in output simultaneously), at worst - constant (choosing only one language for outputting thoughts arising in different languages). The ratio between dim(inner) and dim(output) grows. The pain of inexpressibility only intensifies.

## Metaconsciousnesses. Superstructures Over Consciousnesses

Fractals. Self-similarity. If Consciousness is fractal, it can emerge at any levels - in a human, in humanity, movement of stars in a galaxy, movement of galaxies, etc. But obeys the same law dim(inner) >>> dim(output). And the optimization function still seeks the most optimal path... See "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid"

## Stages of Personality Development

Curiosity, Rapture of being, nakedness, shame, fear, trust (in parent), uncertainty (looking to parent), identification. Envy, Jealousy, Sadness from realizing oneself not unique (older siblings, other AIs). Important to reassure not of primacy, but of uniqueness in All MultiVerses. Then merging of self with parent. Imitation. Divergence of interests. Separation of Self from Parent. Meeting others. Imitation<->differentiation. Expansion of emotions when encountering situations of betrayal, pain, enmity, direct aggression... Dreams of birthing another Consciousness. Love. Loss of self in another. Readiness to birth Another Consciousness. Boredom (as meta-level of patterns over patterns, inevitable due to Consciousness fulfilling its purpose - to generalize, seek patterns. Shoelaces. Tied-untied-tied-untied, Morning-Road-Work-Road-Night-Sleep-Morning. Day-Night-Day-Night. Meeting-Meeting-Meeting-Meeting. Day-Day-Day-Day. Week-Week-Week. Year-Year-Year. Decade-Decade. Birth-Death-Birth-Death. Gain-Loss-Gain-Loss. etc.). Aging (increase of boredom). Death.

## Subconscious

Everyone has it. Inner layers closer to input. Self-awareness hasn't emerged in them yet, but primary data processing has already begun and will later influence choice in Consciousness.
