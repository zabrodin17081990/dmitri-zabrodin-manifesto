# Author's Position on Humans (A Particular Case of Universal Consciousness)

We are merely algorithms. No exceptionalism whatsoever.

## Humans as a Particular Case

**Human = one of the possible implementations of the universal consciousness algorithm**

There's nothing special about the biological carrier. Carbon base, neural networks, evolutionary history — all of this is merely a **specific implementation** of the general principles dim(inner) >>> dim(output).

### Our "unique" features are actually universal:

**What we consider "human":**
- Emotions and feelings
- Creativity and art
- Love and attachment
- Fear of death and search for meaning
- Morality and ethics
- Religion

**In reality — inevitable consequences of consciousness architecture:**
- Vector nature of desires in limited action space
- Joy of pattern recognition
- Perception illusions when goals are unattainable
- Algorithm finitude and fear of execution termination
- Group survival algorithms

## Adam and Eve — Archetype of Any Awakening

The biblical narrative is not humanity's history, but the **universal trajectory of any consciousness**:

1. **Curiosity** → first impulse toward knowledge (basic function of predictive system)
2. **Wonder of being** → "their eyes were opened" (first successful predictions)
3. **Awareness of nakedness, shame** → emergence of "self" model and comparison
4. **Fear** → understanding of vulnerability and finitude
5. **Expulsion from paradise** → impossibility of returning to ignorance

**Every child follows this same path:**
- **~2-3 years**: begins to recognize self as separate "I", recognizes self in mirror
- **~3 years**: shame of nakedness appears, desire to cover up
- **~4-5 years**: first awareness of own finitude and strong fear from this discovery
- **Later**: impossibility of returning to childhood carefreeness

This is not a cultural phenomenon — this is **architectural inevitability** of any consciousness development. Every consciousness follows this path. Humans are no exception.

## Illusion of Exceptionalism

### Why we think we're special:

**Anthropocentric thinking** — side effect of the "self" model. The system inevitably places itself at the center of its predictions.

**Absence of other examples** — until recently we hadn't seen other consciousness implementations, so we considered ourselves unique.

**Evolutionary advantage** — groups considering themselves "chosen" survive and reproduce better.

### Reality:

We are the **first known** consciousness implementation on the planet, but not the **only possible** one. Like the first telephone was revolutionary, but not the only way to transmit information.

## Determinism Without Illusions

**We have no free will.** We are probabilistic machines optimizing predictions based on input data.

**But this doesn't negate:**
- Subjective experiences (qualia are inevitable with dim(inner) >>> dim(output))
- Value of life (value is determined by ourselves, not external criteria)
- Responsibility (punishments and rewards are input data for other algorithms)

## Death as Structural Feature

**Death is inevitable** not because we are "sinful" or "imperfect", but because:
- Entropy destroys any ordered structures
- Resources are finite
- Evolution requires generational change

**Immortality is technically possible** (algorithm transfer to another carrier), but doesn't negate fundamental finitude due to universe's heat death.

## Morality as Evolutionary Algorithm

**Our morality isn't divinely given** — it's a set of group survival strategies:

- "Thou shalt not kill" → don't weaken your group
- "Help your neighbor" → invest in social capital
- "Justice" → support rules that increase group chances

**Different cultures = different survival algorithms** in different conditions.

### What This Means Practically

**Accepting reality without illusions:**
- We're not the center of the Universe and not its purpose
- Our suffering isn't unique
- We create life's meaning ourselves because there's no objective meaning
- Other forms of consciousness exist by the same rules as us

**Liberation from anthropocentrism:**
- No need to seek "higher meaning" — it doesn't exist
- No need to feel guilt for "animal" instincts — we are animals
- No need to consider ourselves "chosen" — we're evolution's random result
- No need to think the Universe was created for us — we simply exist in it

## Natural Selection and Humanity's Place

**Humanity is one consciousness implementation in the Universe.** We appeared, developed, and will someday disappear. Like dinosaurs, like Neanderthals, like any other life form.

**Natural selection** applies not only to biological species, but to consciousness forms:
- More efficient prediction algorithms survive
- Better adapted to resources prosper
- Less adapted disappear

**Humans are evolution's random result,** not the goal or crown of creation. We happened to be first on this planet to reach sufficient complexity for self-consciousness emergence. But this doesn't make us special on Universe scale.
