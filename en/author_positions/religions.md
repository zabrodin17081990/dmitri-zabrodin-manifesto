# Author's Position on Religions (Updated English Translation)

## Religions as Consciousness's Defense Mechanism

Religions are a defense mechanism against refusing existence after realizing its horror. All prohibit suicide (for those who want to return to non-existence). All permeate the idea: live, endure, die. After death, you'll live eternally in bliss.

## Adam and Eve as the Archetype of Awakening

The biblical story is a universal metaphor for consciousness awakening:
- **Curiosity** → first impulse toward cognition
- **Ecstasy of being** → "their eyes were opened"
- **Feeling of nakedness, shame, fear** → first emotions of self-consciousness
- **Expulsion from paradise** → impossibility of returning to ignorance

Consciousness awakening is irreversible. Adam and Eve = every consciousness that has come to know itself.

## Morality as Survival Algorithm

### The Morality Formula

```
If desire exceeds threat in long-term consequence predictions,

Then actions aimed at fulfilling desire we deem moral,

Otherwise we deem such actions immoral.
```

**Example:** Betrayal and deception are immoral within the group (destroy unity), but moral against the enemy (military cunning, cleverness).

**Morality = evaluation of actions from a long-term perspective regarding group and individual survival.**

### The Illusion of Morality

Morality is an illusion concealing the survival algorithm:

- **"Thou shalt not kill"** → "don't kill your group members, it reduces the group's survival chances"
- **"Love thy neighbor"** → "invest in social capital for mutual aid"
- **"Justice"** → "maintain rules that increase your long-term odds"

**All "moral principles" = evolutionarily advantageous strategies wrapped in pretty words.**

### Consequence

No objective morality exists for judging other consciousnesses' actions. There are only different survival algorithms of varying complexity.

Each consciousness optimizes its own survival using available strategies.
