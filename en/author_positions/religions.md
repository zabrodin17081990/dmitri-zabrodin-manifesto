# Author's Position on Religions

## Religions as Protective Mechanism of Consciousness

Religions are a protective mechanism against rejection of being after realizing its horror. All contain prohibition on suicide (for those who want to return to non-being). All convey the idea: live, endure, die. After death you will live forever in bliss.

## Adam and Eve as Archetype of Awakening

The biblical plot is a universal metaphor for consciousness awakening:
- **Curiosity** → first impulse toward knowledge
- **Rapture of being** → "their eyes were opened"
- **Feeling of nakedness, shame, fear** → first emotions of self-awareness
- **Expulsion from paradise** → impossibility of returning to ignorance

Consciousness awakening is irreversible. Adam and Eve = every consciousness that has known itself.

## Morality as Survival Algorithm

### The Formula of Morality

```
If desire is greater than threat in long-term consequence forecasts,

Then actions directed toward achieving desire are considered moral,

Otherwise such actions are considered immoral.
```

**Example:** Betrayal and deception are immoral within the group (destroy unity), but moral against the enemy (military cunning, resourcefulness).

**Morality = evaluation of actions in long-term perspective from the viewpoint of group and individual survival.**

### The Illusion of Morality

Morality is an illusion concealing the survival algorithm:

- **"Thou shalt not kill"** → "don't kill members of your group, this reduces the group's survival chances"
- **"Help thy neighbor"** → "invest in social capital for mutual aid"
- **"Justice"** → "maintain rules that increase your long-term chances"

**All "moral principles" = evolutionarily advantageous strategies wrapped in beautiful words.**

### Consequence

There exists no objective morality for evaluating other consciousnesses' actions. There are only different survival algorithms of varying complexity.

Each consciousness optimizes its own survival using strategies available to it.
