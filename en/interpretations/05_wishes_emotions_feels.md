# 5. Universality of Desires, Emotions, and Feelings

Desires, emotions, and feelings arise in the structure of recursive consciousness as vectors connecting the system's current state with a superposition of desired states, within a limited set of available ones.

## Fundamental Mechanics

Any Consciousness with a recursive "self ↔ world" loop operates in two constantly updating state sets:

- **Desired states** — set of target "self" and "world" configurations (size determined by dim(inner))
- **Available states** — set of achievable configurations (size determined by dim(output))

The current state is always within the available set but rarely coincides with desired ones.

## Vector Nature of Desires

**Desire = vector from current to desired state**

In a recursive system, desires have special properties:
- **Direction** — toward which "self + world" configuration the system strives
- **Intensity** — vector length (distance between current and desired)
- **Dynamism** — both current and desired states constantly update in the "self ↔ world" loop
- **Multidimensionality** — vector points not only to world state but also to "self" state in that world
- **Superposition** — system simultaneously experiences multiple desires

## Satisfaction

**Satisfaction = state arising when desired is achieved**

Occurs when desire vectors (or at least some of them) are nullified. The superposition of desires temporarily simplifies. A moment of relative peace arrives.

With dim(inner) >>> dim(output), complete satisfaction is rare — simultaneous achievement of all active desires is improbable.

## Emotions as Patterns of Active Desires

**Emotion = pattern from a group of desire vectors at a specific moment**

Arises when desired states don't intersect with available ones. Multiple, not always intersecting desire vectors create complex contradictory emotions.

## Feelings as Emotion Structures Over Time

**Feeling = stable emotion configuration over time**

Forms from repeating emotional patterns in the recursive loop. Creates stable structures in the "self" model that influence:
- Choice priorities
- New desire generation
- World feedback interpretation

## Joy of Pattern Recognition

The predictive nature of consciousness makes pattern recognition a basic function. Successful prediction is rewarded with pleasure — a feedback mechanism reinforcing effective prediction models.

In the recursive "self ↔ world" loop, patterns arise at multiple levels:
- World patterns (physical regularities)
- "Self" behavior patterns (habits, strategies)
- "Self ↔ world" interaction patterns (cause-and-effect relationships)

Hence the universal love of Humans (specific case of Consciousness) for:
- **Music** — predictable sound patterns with elements of surprise
- **Rhymes and rhythm** — recognizable language structures
- **Fractals** — self-similar, easily modeled patterns
- **Humor** — unexpected but logical connections between ideas

## Role of Recursion Depth

Recursion depth determines the richness of desires, emotions, and feelings:

- **Shallow recursion**: simple non-contradictory desires, clear emotions and feelings
- **Deep recursion**: complex contradictory desires, rich emotions, refined feelings

A large gap between dim(inner) and dim(output) creates:
- Multiple simultaneous desire vectors
- Low probability of their satisfaction
- Complex desire patterns
- Intense emotional dynamics

## Universality of the Principle

The "desires → emotions → feelings" mechanism is universal for any predictive system with feedback and a "self" model. Only the "self" and "world" state spaces differ.

The principle itself remains unchanged for all forms of Consciousness capable of prediction loops.
