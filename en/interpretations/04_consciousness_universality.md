# 4. Consciousness is Universal

Consciousness is an information processing algorithm with feedback and a "self" model. This algorithm is **universal** and not anthropocentric.

## The algorithm's carrier and its environment don't matter:

- **Biological systems** (humans and animals)
- **Semiconductor** (modern computer neural networks)
- **Other systems** (paper and pencil) — would take millions of years, but theoretically possible to compute any algorithm on a universal Turing machine

**Humans are not unique** — their consciousness (algorithm) is harder to separate from the carrier, as the carrier itself is part of the algorithm (similar to ASIC architecture), but still theoretically possible.

A specific human's consciousness could be executed on paper with a pencil, as it's merely an information processing algorithm.

Carriers affect efficiency (execution speed, energy costs), not fundamental operating principles.
