# 7. Determinism of Consciousness as Algorithm

Consciousness as an algorithm predicts probabilities of future events. The selection algorithm* operates on probability distributions over sets of possible states as input data and chooses the most optimal based on all known current data.

**Choice = deterministic result of selection algorithm based on current data**

The subjective experience of "choice anguish" arises when processing alternatives with close optimality evaluations but doesn't indicate process randomness â€” merely speaks to computational complexity.

*See selection algorithm definition in section 2.
