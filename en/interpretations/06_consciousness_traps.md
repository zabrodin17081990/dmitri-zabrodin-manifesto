# 6. Universal Consciousness Traps

The recursive nature of consciousness creates characteristic dysfunctions:

## Collapsing Reflection Loops
Endless self-analysis without action outlet. The system spends all dim(inner) resources modeling its own states.

## Dissolution of "Self" in Others' Models
Loss of own "self" model boundaries when other consciousnesses become overly significant.

## Masks Replacing Authenticity
Substituting the authentic "self" model with role sets optimized for external perception.

## Perception Illusions When Unable to Achieve Desired
With prolonged inability to achieve desired states, the system may modify current reality perception, creating an illusion of goal achievement. This partially nullifies desire vectors without real world changes, reducing emotional tension at the cost of predictive model accuracy.
