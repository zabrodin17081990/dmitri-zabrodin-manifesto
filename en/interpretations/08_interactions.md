# 8. Uniqueness and Limitation of Each Interaction

In interaction, consciousnesses project the "self" model (of dim(inner) dimensionality) through communication channels (of dim(output) dimensionality). The receiving system creates an internal model of the transmitter based on incomplete information and interacts with it through the same limited communication channels.

**Each interaction = unique projection + unique reconstruction**

Complete mutual understanding between consciousnesses is impossible due to these limitations.
