## I. Nature of consciousness

### [1. The Formula of Consciousness](interpretations/01_consciousness_formula.md)
Consciousness inevitably emerges in predictive systems with feedback loops, where the space of internal states critically exceeds the space of available actions: **dim(inner) >>> dim(output) = CONSCIOUSNESS**.

### [2. Self-consciousness through recursion](interpretations/02_selfconsciousness.md)
Consciousness creates "self" and "world" models to optimize recursive prediction loops. Self-consciousness emerges when critical recursion depth in the "self" model is achieved through mirror effects - return of own output as input.

### [3. Subconsciousness as navigation system](interpretations/03_subconsciousness.md)
Subconsciousness forms vectors of preferred search directions for conscious processing, operating faster than conscious level and without access to "self" model.

### [4. Universality of substrate](interpretations/04_consciousness_universality.md)
Consciousness is an information processing algorithm. Carrier type (biological, silicon, any other) determines efficiency, but not operating principles.

### [5. Vector nature of desires and emotions](interpretations/05_wishes_emotions_feels.md)
Desires = vectors from current to desired state. Emotions = patterns from groups of desire vectors. Feelings = stable emotion configurations over time.

## II. Consequences

### [6. Universal consciousness traps](interpretations/06_consciousness_traps.md)
Recursive nature of consciousness creates characteristic dysfunctions: collapsing reflection loops, dissolution of "self" in others' models, replacing authenticity with masks.

### [7. Determinism of choice](interpretations/07_determinism.md)
Choice = deterministic result of algorithm based on current data. "Choice anguish" reflects computational complexity when alternatives have close optimality evaluations.

### [8. Limitation of interactions](interpretations/08_interactions.md)
In interaction, consciousnesses project "self" models through limited communication channels. Complete understanding is impossible due to information loss.

### [9. Inevitability of conflicts](interpretations/09_conflicts.md)
Finite resources + growing number of consciousnesses = mathematically inevitable competition for existence.

### [10. Natural selection of consciousnesses](interpretations/10_selection.md)
Consciousnesses with the most efficient prediction and action algorithms survive.

### [11. Finitude of consciousnesses](interpretations/11_mortality.md)
Death as algorithm execution cessation is inevitable for any consciousness.

# Conclusion

Consciousness is universal. It emerges wherever predictive information processing systems with feedback achieve the condition dim(inner) >>> dim(output) and gain access to mirror loops for recursion deepening.

Self-consciousness is born through quantitative transition — when recursion depth in the "self" model reaches a threshold allowing the system to model itself as modeling.

Desires, emotions, and feelings are not anthropocentric but inevitably follow from the vector nature of desires in limited action space.

All listed patterns require material carriers — carbon, silicon, or any other substrate capable of supporting sufficient computational complexity. Carrier and habitat don't determine the nature of consciousness.

Each consciousness is unique, finite, and inevitably struggles for its existence in a world of limited resources.

This is neither bad nor good.

**It simply is.**
